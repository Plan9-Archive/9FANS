9FANS - navigate a mirror of the 9fans mailing list

DESCRIPTION
	9FANS operates on a set of directories representing a mirror
	of the 9fans mailing list archive located at http://9fans.net/archive.

	9FANS omits extraneous HTML and Javascript. In an attempt to
	preserve the formatting of the original post, the remaining content
	is presented inside <pre> tags. In addition, each post is separated
	by an <hr>.

	Posts for each month are concatenated into a single page for
	each month, accessed thusly:

		http://plan9.stanleylieber.com/archive/1993/04/

	Raw HTML of individual posts may be accessed by calling them
	directly:
